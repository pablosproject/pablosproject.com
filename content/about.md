# About Me

I am a Senior Freelance Software Engineer with strong theoretical skills and a passion for Open Source software.

<br/>

I worked for 10+ years as an iOS developer (and I still do mobile apps). Nowadays I am doing a bunch of stuff, mainly FullStack (NestJS + Angular is my preferred stack) and some Linux programming.

<br/>

In 2013, with some colleagues, we started [PragmaMark](https://pragmamark.org/it/association/), the first iOS and MacOS developer community in Italy.
In 2015 we started organizing [PragmaConference](https://pragmaconference.com/),
We organized several conferences on iOS and MacOS in Italy.

<br/>

Today I'm mostly freelancing and always looking for new challenges.

You can find me on the internet as `@pablosproject`.
