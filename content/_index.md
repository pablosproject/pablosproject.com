# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer who enjoys solving complex problems across the stack.

Good engineering principles transfer across domains. I've seen it firsthand, working on mobile apps, backend systems, hardware appliances, and everything in between.

Currently I work primarily with TypeScript and Node.js, with React on the frontend when needed. But I care more about the problem than the tool.

I work with companies of all sizes—startups, scaleups, and established organizations.
